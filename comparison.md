# File Storage vs Memory Storage Comparison

| Aspect | **File Storage** | **Memory (Array)** |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Speed** | ~5-50ms per read/write | <0.001ms (microseconds) |
| **Memory Usage** | Low (only when reading) | ~2-5MB constant |
| **Persistence** | ✅ Survives restarts | ❌ Lost on restart |
| **Multi-Script Access** | ✅ Can share between scripts | ❌ Single script only |
| **API Calls** | Once, then read from file | Once per script run |
| **Disk I/O** | Every access | None |
| **Real-time Updates** | Need to reload file | Instant |
| **Crash Recovery** | ✅ Data preserved | ❌ Must refetch |
| **Network Dependency** | Only on initial fetch | Every script start |
| **Best For** | Multiple scripts, backup needed | Single long-running script |

## Recommendation

- **Use Memory (Array)** if:
  - Single script running 24/7
  - Need fastest possible access
  - Script handles WebSocket subscriptions
  
- **Use File Storage** if:
  - Multiple scripts need symbols
  - Want backup/recovery
  - Scripts restart frequently
